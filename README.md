# pcl_indoorPlaneSegmentation
This PCL perception tool is used to identify target plane for a semi autonomous painting robot. Potential planes within working distance will be identified, then further classifided to their type. The pointcloud will then be stored in a vector of struct for further used. A visualizer is used to visualized the segmentation result.
